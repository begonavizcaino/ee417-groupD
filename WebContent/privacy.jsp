                            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature

                            has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that 
                            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted 
                            that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy

                                development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal data.
