                                            <p><h2>Student Advisers</h2>The Student Advisers provide support for all students throughout their university experience. Each programme has a dedicated Student Adviser who is your gateway to support services. Additionally, there are Student Advisers attached to specific groups of students, such as mature and postgraduate research students.  If you are experiencing any difficulties the Student Advisers will give you the time and space to talk things through. 
                                            <br><br><h2>Student Health Service</h2>The Student Health Service provides on-campus medical, 
                               				counselling and psychiatric care to registered students of the university.
                                 			All consultations are treated in strict confidence. There is a charge for 
                                 			the medical and psychiatric service while the counselling service is free.
                                  			Dental treatment is relatively expensive, students are advised 
                                  			to have a check-up before they leave home.
                                  			The Student Health Service does not provide dental treatment. 
                                  			However, if dental treatment is required, they can provide the name of a local dentist.
                                  			<br><br><h2>Language Difficulties</h2>Some international students can experience language difficulties 
                                  			and problems understanding accents at first. Likewise, lecturers and domestic students might experience 
                                  			difficulties adjusting to your accent!
											To alleviate these problems, it may be useful to try speaking more slowly and clearly than you usually 
											would and, likewise, if you have difficulty understanding other people in your class (or the lecturer), it is quite acceptable to approach
											the tutor or the lecturer, explain your problem, and ask that they do the same for you.
											<br><br><h2>Students' Union</h2>
				                            All students are members of the Students' Union. The  International

				                            students. the Students' Union also have officers who provide welfare services and accommodation information.
